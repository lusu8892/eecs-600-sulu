PS8: vision-guided motion

This assignment will be simulation only.  The scenario is:

*select a patch of points on the table top

*have Baxter position its tool coordinate frame with the origin coincident with the table top and the tool-frame z-axis pointing into the table top, oriented normal to the surface

*starting from this point, have Baxter perform a "wiping" motion, as though cleaning the table
