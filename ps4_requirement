Modify the minimal robot description to add an additional link and movable joint.

Modify the minimal controller to control this 2nd joint as well.

Command your robot in Gazebo to oscillate the two movable joints in sinusoids (at a different frequency for joint 1 vs joint 2).

Submit all of your modified code, plus a movie (screen capture) of your robot's chaotic motion.  (You can use Kazaam for this).
